        <h1>Screen Time and Mental Wellness — Final Project (2025)</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        Digital screens have become one of the most dominant environments in modern human life. Messaging,
        studying, entertainment, and work all take place through digital interfaces, making screens a central
        part of how people communicate, learn, and function daily. While screen use is not inherently harmful,
        research increasingly suggests that the quality, duration, and timing of screen exposure influence
        stress levels, sleep cycles, mood stability, and attention span.
        </p>

        <p>
        This project investigates these patterns using a dataset of 400 participants aged 16–55. The dataset
        includes variables such as mobile screen time, laptop hours, TV hours, sleep quality ratings,
        stress levels, productivity scores, and mood/energy indicators. The goal is to understand not only
        whether screen exposure affects mental wellness, but how its impact varies across different user groups:
        students vs professionals, light vs heavy users, and younger vs older demographics.
        </p>

        <p>
        As digital devices increasingly replace physical and social environments, issues like digital fatigue,
        burnout, and poor sleep are becoming widespread. This project uses data visualization and exploratory
        analysis to generate insights and design recommendations for educators, product designers,
        and policymakers.

        <!-- GRAPH 1 -->
        <h2>Graph 1 — Average Screen Time by Device</h2>
        <p>
        Laptop usage is highest among participants, followed by mobile and TV. This suggests that most screen
        exposure is tied to work or study.

        <!-- GRAPH 2 -->
        <h2>Graph 2 — Screen Time vs Stress Level</h2>
        <p>
        A positive correlation is visible: as total screen time increases, stress scores rise. A cluster at
        6–8 hours indicates highest vulnerability to burnout.

        <!-- GRAPH 3 -->
        <h2>Graph 3 — Sleep Quality vs Screen Time Groups</h2>
        <p>
        Sleep quality drops sharply for heavy screen-time users, especially those using phones late at night.

        <!-- GRAPH 4 -->
        <h2>Graph 4 — Correlation Heatmap</h2>
        <p>
        The heatmap shows strong relationships: Screen time increases stress, reduces sleep quality, and
        indirectly affects mood and productivity.
